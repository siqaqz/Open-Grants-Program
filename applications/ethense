## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

Please provide the following:

* Ethense *versioned ethics licensed NFT subdomains*
* *Blockchain Ethics Library* as lexical code
* codified DRY texts towards linked action
* Polkadot incubated

### Project Details

We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about your project's expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):

*Dfinity l1 blockchain perhaps a bit

*Cohesion towards a versioned and licensed domain will be the expectation of the license and aqequete lexical towards trust and domain name choices and their testable truths.
** The actualized starts with custodians of emotives to spawn the expectation of thinking

### Ecosystem Fit

* Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
* Audience those who can adopt code cicd as open and maintain their naming about the testable interest within domain stability.
* Day-old internet, baked with tests, cheaper to keep and read
* Posdibly Dfinity in spirit of protocol, given a typical financiers model
  * Ethense is human knowledge based and funds itself as pepetual requires of it

## Development Status :open_book:

If you've already started implementing your project or it is part of a larger repository, please provide a link and a description of the code here. In any case, please provide some documentation on the research and other work you have conducted before applying. This could be:
* https://twitter.com/aquaqlabs/status/1387553375345025025?s=19
* IETF mailing list
* Pinned u/aquaqlabs Reddit
* Pinned @aquaqlabs twitter

## Development Roadmap

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to Substrate, Kusama or Polkadot. We _recommend_ that the scope of the work can fit within a three-month period and that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

For each milestone,

* make sure to include a specification of your software. _Treat it as a contract_; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../src/grant_guidelines_per_category.md).
* include the amount of funding requested _per milestone_.
* include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
* provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
* commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
* indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone.
* **Deliverables 0a-0d are mandatory for all milestones**, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

> :zap: If any of your deliverables is based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish _under the terms of the license_ of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.**

### Overview

* **Total Estimated Duration:** 6 months
* **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):** 6 FTEs
* **Total Costs:** 24,000 USD

### Milestone 1- Emotive Subdomains with licenses and auctions
* **Estimated duration:* 6 weeks
* **FTE:** 2
* **Costs:** 3500

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| -----: | ----------- | ------------- |
| 0a. | License | Ethense versioned
| 0b. | Documentation | *inline* as ENS lexical domains and fleek deployments

We will provide both **inline documentation** of the code and a basic **tutorial** that explains how a user can (for example) spin up one of our Substrate nodes and send test transactions, which will show how the new functionality works. |
| 0c. | Testing Guide | Core functions will be fully covered by unit tests to ensure functionality and robustness. In the guide, we will describe how to run these tests. |
| 0d. | Docker | We will provide a Dockerfile(s) that can be used to test all the functionality delivered with this milestone. |
| 0e. | Article | We will publish an **article**/workshop that explains [...] (what was done/achieved as part of the grant). (Content, language and medium should reflect your target audience described above.)
| 1. | Substrate module: X | We will create a Substrate module that will... (Please list the functionality that will be implemented for the first milestone) |  
| 2. | Substrate module: Y | We will create a Substrate module that will... |  
| 3. | Substrate module: Z | We will create a Substrate module that will... |  
| 4. | Substrate chain | Modules X, Y & Z of our custom chain will interact in such a way... (Please describe the deliverable here as detailed as possible) |  


### Milestone 2 Example — Additional features

* **Estimated Duration:** 1 month
* **FTE:**  1
* **Costs:** 4,000 USD
